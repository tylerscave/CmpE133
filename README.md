# About
# Installation
This program uses JavaFX 8u40 for the GUI and therefore requires having Java 8 installed. Download and unzip the source files. The program can be run via the command line or an IDE. 

To run in Eclipse, open the source folder as a new Java project. Go into the main folder and run Main.java for the GUI version or CLIMain.java for the command line version.
Alternatively, the program can be compiled via the command line by navigating to the src folder and entering: 
`javac model/*.java controller/*.java main/*.java` 
and run after compiling with: 
`java main.Main`
The command line version can be run with:
`java main.CLIMain`
